## Unresolved Issues

- Error with hashing not allowing me to log in as the same user more than once
- Error with the 'New Project" function not allowing me to add a new task from the 'New Project' form -- works in Postman & shows up in Robo 3T
- Error with the 'New Task" function not allowing me to add a new task from the 'New Task' form -- works in Postman & shows up in Robo 3T
- 'Delete Project' button currently just for showing intent, it doesn't actually work yet
- 'Delete Task' button currently not in here but somehow I'm sure it wouldn't be working in this version of the app
